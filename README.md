# eye-disease-detection-using-CNN-and-SVM
dataset contains 600 images of patients with cataract and without cataracts out of which we have used 400 images.
preprocessing steps like image augmentation is used to make model robust by increasing size and variety of data.
model was build using various layers like conv2d ,maxpool,dense layer.
Then training and testing of model was done and final accuracy obtained using cnn and validation accuracy was obtained to be 85.4%.
SVM Provided an accuracy of 87.5%
